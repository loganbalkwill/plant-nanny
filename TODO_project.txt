This file is meant to outline the general project "to do" list
    It is not meant for outlining "to do" or "fix me" statements for existing code; 
    Those statements will exist within the code itself

TODO:
    - build requirements.txt file for project dependencies
    - database setup script if database doesn't already exist (typically for initial setup)
